# 🎯 IMPROVED AI RESPONSES - BEFORE vs AFTER

## ❌ **BEFORE** (Verbose, Messy):
```
Hello! 😊 I'm HealthyAI, here to help you understand this prescription. The image shows a prescription for Agatha Peralta, a 14-year-old female, dated February 4, 2011.

The prescription is for:

* **Bioquine 500mg tablets (Paracetamol):** This is a brand name for Paracetamol, also known as acetaminophen. It's a common over-the-counter pain reliever and fever reducer.

* **Dosage:** Take 1 tablet every 4 hours as needed.

* **Quantity:** 12 tablets

**Important Considerations:**

* **Outdated Prescription:** This prescription is over a decade old and is therefore no longer valid. Do not attempt to fill or use this prescription.

* **Dosage and Use:** The instructions indicate the medication should be taken as needed, but it's crucial to follow a doctor's instructions on appropriate dosages and frequency. Taking too much paracetamol can be harmful to the liver.

* **Underlying Condition:** Paracetamol treats symptoms, not the underlying cause. If you are experiencing pain or fever, it's essential to consult a doctor to determine the cause and receive appropriate treatment.
